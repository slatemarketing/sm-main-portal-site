This project is a website, and portal for Slate Marketing. Slate marketing is a small marketing agency with a focus on PPC (Pay Per Click) Advertising. We do also offer other solutions.

The main purpose of this website is to attract new clients, and be a client / admin portal.

The client side of this portal should act by giving clients dashboards to show info, a profile so they can update their information such as client name, etc. An invoices page for them to see their latestst invoices, and pay them, and these will be given out by the admins. And settings to change some basic settings.

The admin side should consist of being able to look at all the clients information, profile, invoices, and settings. They should be able to update all of this, and provide invoices, and their status of paid or unpaid, etc.
